### Objectives
Pediatric_game is a simulation game made by Tennis Tooth Team for **Chelsea & Westminster Hospital**. This game follows a linear playthrough from start to finish and simulates the experiences of a child during a visit/medical examination in the hospital.Each hospital room in Pediatric_game is designed based on the actual room in the hospital. The game tries to be as realistic as possible by using the staff members' images and actors in the game so the kids have an idea of what they will be going through.
